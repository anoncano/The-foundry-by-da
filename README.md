# The Foundry by DA

This is a simple Next.js + Firebase project. It **requires Node.js 20** or newer.

## Setup

Install dependencies (required before building):

```bash
npm ci
```

If you skip this step, `npm run build` will fail with `next: not found`.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The app includes placeholder dashboards for workers and clients and a basic sign-up wizard for workers.
